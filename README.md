## 1. Multi-Stage Boot Process:

STAGE_RESET: Initial system reset
STAGE_ROM_VERIFY: Verify ROM contents
STAGE_BOOTLOADER_LOAD: Load bootloader from flash
STAGE_BOOTLOADER_VERIFY: Verify bootloader integrity
STAGE_SECURE_BOOT: Final secure boot stage
STAGE_ERROR: Handle security violations


## 2. Security Features:

Bootloader signature verification
Separate hash verification for ROM and bootloader
Anti-rollback protection with version checking
Security violation detection and handling
Boot timing measurements
Memory access controls


## 3. Flash Interface:

Controlled bootloader loading from flash
Address generation for flash reads
Data buffering for verification


## 4. Verification Process:

Two-stage hash verification (ROM and bootloader)
Signature checking
Version validation
Timing checks


## 5. Security Outputs:

Boot stage tracking
Security violation flags
Verification status signals
Boot readiness indication



## To implement this in your system:

Connect the flash interface to your actual flash memory
Update the hash constants with your actual values
Adjust the bootloader size and address range as needed
Implement any additional security measures specific to your system
